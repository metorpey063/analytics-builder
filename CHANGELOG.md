# Changelog

All notable changes to AIO Analytics Builder are documented here.

---

## 2026-09-10 — Standardize walkthrough labels + Pulse dashboard prompt

### Changed
- **Walkthrough .docx format**: all builds (Pulse and Tableau Next) now use **"Ask:"** / **"Expected response:"** labels in Section 3. Deprecated "Action:" / "Audience sees:" labels for consistency across platforms.
- **`/build-demo` skill**: when user selects `pulse` output mode, immediately ask whether to also create a Tableau Dashboard (Step 5a). Previously this was only asked post-build.

---

## 2026-08-27 — Tableau Dashboard Builder (.twb workbook generation)

### Added

**`twb_builder.py` — programmatic Tableau workbook generation and publish**

Generates valid `.twb` XML workbooks from a config dict and publishes them to Tableau Cloud via `server.workbooks.publish()`. No Tableau Desktop required — the XML is hand-authored using patterns reverse-engineered from Desktop-saved reference files.

Key features:
- Live `sqlproxy` connection to already-published datasources (no embed)
- Embedded Pulse metric tiles — live KPI cards with BAN, comparison, sparkline
- Multiple chart types: horizontal_bar, bar, line, multi-line (color split), dual_axis (bar+line combo)
- Auto-adapting dashboard layouts: 2×2 grid, side-by-side, 2+1, 3+N patterns
- Global dimension filters wired to all worksheets
- Brand-colored title text
- Deterministic UUIDs for idempotent rebuilds

Dashboard components:
- Filter row (all dimension fields as dropdown filters)
- Styled title zone (brand-colored text)
- Pulse metric tile row (renders live from Pulse metric IDs)
- Viz content grid (auto-layout based on worksheet count)

Integration:
- Added as optional Phase 5 in `/build-demo` for Pulse demos (y/n prompt)
- `get_datasource_content_url()` handles Tableau's timestamp-appended content URLs
- Requires "Allow Tableau-built extensions" in site Settings → Extensions for Pulse tiles

### Fixed

- Pulse Discover AI: documented that "Enable In-Region Model Requests Only" in the backing Salesforce org blocks Tableau Pulse AI silently — disable to fix

---

## 2026-08-06 — Add /transfer-assets Command (Cross-Org Dashboard Deployment)

### Added

**`/transfer-assets` — new skill for moving Tableau Next dashboards between orgs**

Packages a dashboard from a source Salesforce org and deploys it to a target org using the Tableau Next Package & Deploy API (`next-package-deploy.demo.tableau.com`). Solves the cross-org field name mismatch problem (auto-generated suffixes like `region6` vs `region1`) that previously made programmatic dashboard copying unreliable.

Key features:
- Guided flow: select source/target profiles, choose dashboard, deploy
- Automatic DLO name patching (source org UUID suffix → target org UUID suffix)
- "Create new" mode deploys a fresh workspace + SDM with correct field structure
- "Use existing" mode validates dependencies and builds a field mapping
- Package saved locally as `.json` for re-use if deployment fails

API endpoints discovered and documented:
- `GET /api/v1/dashboards/list` — list dashboards in connected org
- `POST /api/v1/dashboards/package` — async package job
- `POST /api/v1/deployment/deploy` — async deploy with workspace/SDM options
- `POST /api/v1/deployment/validate-requirements` — pre-flight validation

---

## 2026-08-03 — Always Build Dashboard + Fix PKCE Token Rotation

### Changed

**`/build-demo` skill — always create visualizations and dashboard for Tableau Next demos**

Previously the skill asked "Would you also like me to build a dashboard?" after creating the SDM and metrics. This resulted in workspaces appearing empty in the Tableau Next UI when users declined (or the question was skipped). Vizzes and dashboards are now always created — the workspace must have assets visible so the demo audience can see them.

### Fixed

---

## 2026-08-03 — Fix PKCE Token Rotation for Refresh Grants

### Fixed

**`connections.py` — PKCE `code_verifier` handling on refresh token grants**

Some Salesforce orgs reject `code_verifier` on refresh grants ("unexpected code verifier") while others require it ("invalid code verifier"). Previously the code tried without first, which worked — but on orgs with refresh token rotation enabled, the first attempt burned the single-use token before the retry could succeed.

**New behavior:**
- First call auto-detects whether the org requires or rejects `code_verifier` on refresh
- Saves the learned mode (`pkce_refresh_mode: "required" | "rejected"`) to the profile config
- All subsequent calls use the correct mode without probing, preventing token burn

This fixes `400 expired access/refresh token` errors on PKCE-enforced orgs with token rotation (e.g. Jordan's Tableau Next org pattern).

---

## 2026-07-21 — Self-Healing Dates Without Prep Flows

### Changed

**Pulse date refresh: replaced Prep flows with `.tdsx` calculated Date pattern**

Previous: build a `.tflx` Prep flow → publish → schedule daily/weekly → flow recalculates `DATEADD(Day_Offset, TODAY())` at runtime. Required scheduling, could fail, added maintenance burden.

New: publish `.hyper` with stored Date (indexes immediately) → create metrics → overwrite with `.tdsx` containing `Date = DATEADD('day', [Day_Offset], TODAY())`. Self-heals forever with zero maintenance — no flow, no scheduling, no refresh needed.

**How it works:**
- `TODAY()` is an unstable function — Tableau re-evaluates it on every query and never materializes it into the extract
- The calculated `Date` field slides forward by one day automatically, every day, with no intervention
- Metrics survive the overwrite because the LUID is preserved and the field name (`"Date"`) stays the same

### Added

**`tdsx_builder.py`** — new module for self-healing Pulse datasources:
- `publish_hyper_for_indexing(df, date_column, ...)` — Step 1: publish `.hyper` with stored Date
- `convert_to_self_healing(df, date_column, ...)` — Step 2: overwrite with `.tdsx` (call AFTER metrics are created)
- `build_hyper_with_date()` / `build_tdsx()` — lower-level builders

### Important

- **Metrics must be created BETWEEN steps 1 and 2** — after the `.hyper` indexes but before the `.tdsx` overwrite
- `prep_flow_builder.py` is kept as a fallback but is no longer the primary approach
- The "Actions Required" section for Pulse builds no longer needs a "Schedule the flow" step
- Restore point: `git tag pre-tdsx-selfheal` — revert with `git reset --hard pre-tdsx-selfheal` if needed

---

## 2026-07-09 — /update Overhaul + Walkthrough Format Standard + Parallel Research

### Fixed

**/update now guarantees identical code across all users (eliminates merge conflicts)**

Previously, `/update` used `git pull` which could fail with merge conflicts when Claude had made local inline fixes to shared files during a build session. Users would get stuck in a conflicted state or end up with stale/divergent code.

**What changed:**
- Replaced `git pull` with `git reset --hard origin/main` — forces all tracked files to match the repository byte-for-byte
- `config.json` is stash-protected (never overwritten)
- `demos/` folder is gitignored (never touched)
- No confirmation prompt — `/update` always proceeds immediately

**Why this matters:** When a bug is found and fixed during one user's session, the fix gets pushed to git. Previously, other users might not get that exact fix due to merge conflicts or local divergence. Now every `/update` guarantees they're running the same code.

### Added

**Walkthrough .docx format standard (codified in CLAUDE.md)**

All demo walkthroughs now follow a consistent 4-section structure:
1. **Demo Scenario** — About the company + Audience & Story
2. **Metrics Reference** — "What it measures" / "Why it matters" per metric
3. **Concierge Prompts** — Ask / Expected response pairs (live from Pulse Discover API when available)
4. **Business Preferences (SDM)** — Copy-paste text for Concierge configuration

This ensures every demo walkthrough feels like the same polished product regardless of who built it or which use case.

**Parallel company research during /build-demo**

Research agent now launches in the background immediately after learning the company name, while the conversation continues (use case, persona, signal, metrics, advanced mode questions). Eliminates 30-90 seconds of dead wait during the build flow.

**Platform indexing outage documentation**

Added guidance for HTTP 400706 errors from Tableau Cloud's catalog indexing service. This is a platform-side issue (not a code bug) that occasionally affects `prod-useast-b` and other pods. Users now get clear instructions: wait for recovery, then retry via checkpoint.

### How to get this update

**If you already have git set up:**
```
/update
```
That's it. The new `/update` command will hard-reset your tracked files to match the repo.

**If you've never updated before or hit a merge conflict previously:**

Run these commands manually in your terminal (from the AIO Analytics Builder directory):
```bash
git fetch origin main
git reset --hard origin/main
```
This will fix any conflicted state and put you on the latest code. Your `config.json` and `demos/` folder will not be affected.

**After updating:** Start a new Claude Code session so the updated skill files and CLAUDE.md take effect.

---

## 2026-07-06 — Prep Flow Auto-Refresh + Build Workflow Restructure

### Added

**`prep_flow_builder.py` — Automated date refresh via Tableau Prep flows**

Programmatically builds self-contained `.tflx` Prep flows that keep Pulse demo dates fresh automatically. The flow embeds the CSV data with relative day offsets and calculates `Date = DATEADD('day', [Day_Offset], TODAY())` at runtime. When scheduled daily/weekly on Tableau Cloud, demos never go stale.

- `build_prep_flow(df, date_column, datasource_name, ...)` — generates the .tflx
- `publish_and_run_flow(flow_path, flow_name, ...)` — publishes to Tableau Cloud and triggers execution

**Post-build "Actions Required" section**

Every `/build-demo` completion now prints a clear **Actions Required** section listing only the manual steps the user is responsible for (schedule the flow, set goals, paste business preferences). Each action has Where/Do/Why format.

### Changed

**Pulse build order restructured: flow-first approach**

Previous: publish .hyper → create metrics → create flow (afterthought)
New: build Prep flow → run flow (creates published datasource) → create metrics against it

Benefits:
- Datasource is "owned" by the flow from the start
- No separate `.hyper` publish step needed
- No auth mismatch when the flow overwrites on scheduled runs
- Single source of truth: the flow IS the datasource publisher

### Fixed

**Pulse definition ID parsing**

The POST `/api/-/pulse/definitions` response wraps everything under a `"definition"` key:
```
resp["definition"]["metadata"]["id"]      → definition ID
resp["definition"]["metrics"][0]["id"]    → metric ID (no separate GET needed)
```
Previously documented as `resp.get("metadata", {}).get("id")` which returned None.

---

## 2026-06-23 — Fix Pulse Insights API language/locale enum format

### Fixed

**Brief API requires enum-format `language` and `locale` fields**

The Pulse brief endpoint (`POST /api/-/pulse/insights/brief`) requires `"LANGUAGE_EN_US"` and `"LOCALE_EN_US"` — not plain strings like `"en"` or `"en_US"`. Using plain strings causes a silent 400 "Invalid request" with no detail about which field is wrong.

---

## 2026-06-23 — Add /update command

### Added

**`/update` slash command** — Pulls the latest version from git, shows what changed, and summarizes updates in plain language. Other SEs can now run `/update` instead of manually running `git pull`.

---

## 2026-06-23 — Fix allowed_dimensions format + response parsing in Pulse payloads

### Fixed

**Pulse `allowed_dimensions` must be flat strings, not objects**

`extension_options.allowed_dimensions` requires a flat list of field name strings (e.g. `["Region", "Program Type"]`). Using objects like `[{"field": "Region"}]` causes a silent 400 "Invalid request". Updated CLAUDE.md Known Pitfalls and build-demo skill with the correct format.

**Pulse definition creation response parsing**

Definition ID is nested under `metadata.id` in the POST response — not at the top level or under `definition.id`. Incorrect parsing caused `def_id=None`, which broke the `GET /definitions/{def_id}/metrics` call and prevented subscriptions from being created in the same run.

---

## 2026-06-23 — Pulse 2026.2 Payload Fix + Canary Validator

### Fixed

**Pulse metric creation broken after Tableau Cloud 2026.2 release**

Root cause: 2026.2 added stricter payload validation to `POST /api/-/pulse/definitions`. Fields that were previously optional are now required, and aggregation/format combinations are now validated. The generic 400 "Invalid request" error gives no detail about which field is wrong — took 4 days of debugging to isolate.

**New required fields in 2026.2:**
- `extension_options` — must be present (with `allowed_dimensions`, `allowed_granularities`, etc.)
- `insights_options` — must be present (can have empty `settings: []`)
- `comparisons` — must be present (can have empty `comparisons: []`)

**New validation rules:**
- `AGGREGATION_AVERAGE` requires `is_running_total: false` — combining AVERAGE with running total now returns 400
- `NUMBER_FORMAT_TYPE_PERCENTAGE` cannot be used with `AGGREGATION_SUM`
- Sentiment must use SCREAMING_SNAKE format (`SENTIMENT_TYPE_UP_IS_GOOD`, not `SentimentTypeUpIsGood`)
- Subscriptions payload changed to flat format: `{"metric_id": "...", "followers": [{"group_id": "..."}]}`

### Added

**Pulse API Canary Validator** (`pulse_validator.py`)
- Runs against 10ax.online.tableau.com (first pod to receive each release)
- Tests 8 payload variations: AVERAGE/SUM/COUNT aggregations, NUMBER/CURRENCY formats, sentiment types, PATCH, subscriptions
- Integrated into `/build-demo`: runs automatically weekly or when the canary pod's build version changes
- If tests fail, warns the user that a breaking change is incoming before it hits their production site
- Credentials stored in `config.json` (pulse_validation profile), not hardcoded

### Changed
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` Known Pitfalls with 2026.2 payload requirements
- Updated `/build-demo` Phase 3 (Pulse metrics) with correct payload format and code example
- Renamed `/refresh-demo` → `/refresh-dates` (Pulse-only, clarified in all docs)
- Moved Advanced Mode from step 0b to step 4c (after metrics are decided)

---

## 2026-06-23 — Session Summaries + CRMA in About Info

### Added
- **Session summaries** — `/build-demo` now saves a structured session summary after every build (company, decisions, assets, resume instructions). Enables "pick up where you left off" in future conversations.
- **New/resume prompt** — `/build-demo` now asks at the start whether this is a new build or resuming an existing one. If resuming, loads the session summary and skips completed phases.
- **Generic session summaries** — long working conversations (troubleshooting, debugging, multi-step projects) offer to save a summary at the end for future context restore.
- **Updated README + OVERVIEW** — CRMA now listed as the 4th output mode alongside Pulse, Next, and CSV in all project documentation.

---

## 2026-06-19 — Rename /refresh-demo → /refresh-dates

### Changed
- Renamed `/refresh-demo` skill to `/refresh-dates` to clarify its purpose
- Updated description: this is **Pulse-only** — Tableau Next demos use self-healing Display Date formula and never need refreshing
- Simplified the Tableau Next section in the skill (just notes dates are self-healing, no re-ingest offered)
- Updated all references across CLAUDE.md, OVERVIEW.md, README.md, and build-demo.md
- Moved Advanced Mode in `/build-demo` from step 0b (before company name) to step 4c (after metrics are decided) — signal tuning is more meaningful once you know the actual metrics

---

## 2026-06-16 — CRM Analytics (CRMA) Output Mode

### Added

**CRM Analytics as 4th output mode** (`crma_uploader.py`, `crma_dashboard_builder.py`)
- Full dataset upload via InsightsExternalData API (metadata → base64 CSV chunks → process → poll)
- Automatic field schema generation from METRIC_CONFIG and dimension lists
- CRMA dashboard builder: SAQL steps (time series, grouped bars, KPIs), chart widgets, filter dropdowns, text headers
- Brand color integration: background container, text colors, chart themes
- App/folder management: find_or_create_app for organizing assets
- Security predicate helper for row-level security on datasets
- CRMA guidance document integrated into build flow (SAQL pitfalls, PATCH rules, field naming)

---

## 2026-06-10 — Viz Template Library + Validation Engine + Dashboard Builder

### Added

**Visualization template library** (`viz_templates.py`, `viz_builder.py`)
- 9 chart templates: trend_over_time, multi_series_line, bar_by_category, stacked_bar, horizontal_bar, donut, scatter, heatmap, funnel
- Auto-recommends chart types from METRIC_CONFIG based on field names and aggregation patterns
- Builds complete API payloads with correct fields, encodings, style, marks, legends
- Infers number formats (%, $, decimals) from field name patterns
- Supports brand color palettes and style overrides
- Adapted from alaviron/tableau-skills template library (internal Salesforce)

**Pre-POST validation engine** (`viz_validator.py`)
- 17 rules checking all known API failure modes before hitting the endpoint
- Validates: root fields, view structure, visualSpecification keys, marks structure, style (fonts/lines/axis/encodings/headers), encoding field references, donut requirements, size encoding support
- Catches errors locally instead of learning from 400 responses
- Returns actionable fix suggestions for each failure

**Dashboard layout builder** (`dashboard_builder.py`)
- 4 layout patterns: standard (3 metrics + 2x2 vizzes), metrics_heavy (6 metrics + 3 vizzes), story_flow (3 metrics + wide hero + 2-up), wide_viz (3 metrics + 2 full-width)
- Auto-selects pattern based on widget counts
- Produces complete dashboard payload with widgets dict, layouts, containers
- ASCII preview generation for user confirmation before building
- 72-column grid with rowspan 15 metric cards (matches our existing preference)

**Style defaults module** (`style_defaults.py`)
- Font builder (7 required keys), line builder (4 keys), shading, field labels
- Brand color override system
- Number format helpers for axis, encoding, and header fields
- Marks header/panes style builders with all v66.12 required fields

---

## 2026-06-05 — Pulse Refresh Pattern + Dynamic Offset + /refresh-demo Rewrite

### Changed

**Pulse date freshness: refresh-based instead of self-healing**
- `.tdsx` packages NEVER index on Tableau Cloud (confirmed: 14+ hours with no indexing, across multiple tests with both hand-crafted and Cloud-format `.tdsx` files)
- True self-healing via calculated fields is not possible for Pulse on Tableau Cloud
- New pattern: publish `.hyper` → set `use_dynamic_offset: True` via PATCH → run `/refresh-demo` before meetings to regenerate data anchored to today
- Metrics survive `.hyper` datasource overwrites — no deletion/recreation needed on refresh

**`/refresh-demo` rewritten from scratch**
- Old purpose: upgrade legacy demos to `.tdsx` self-healing (no longer applicable)
- New purpose: regenerate data + re-publish `.hyper` to keep Pulse dates fresh
- Supports refreshing a single demo by slug or all demos at once
- ~30 seconds to refresh (data gen + publish)
- Optional Tableau Next re-ingest for demos that also use Data Cloud

### Added

**Pulse 26.2 API findings documented**
- `extension_options` must be set via PATCH (not accepted in POST create payload)
- `temporality: 'TEMPORALITY_UNSPECIFIED'` causes 400 on create — field is read-only
- PATCH Content-Type: `application/vnd.tableau.metricqueryservice.v1.UpdateDefinitionRequest+json`

---

## 2026-06-04 — Pulse .hyper Direct Publish Fix

### Fixed

**Pulse datasource indexing: publish .hyper directly, never .tdsx**
- Publishing `.tdsx` packages causes Pulse to take 2+ hours (or indefinitely) to index the datasource — metric creation fails with 404 "Not Found" during that window
- Publishing `.hyper` directly allows Pulse to index in seconds and metric creation succeeds immediately
- Root cause: Pulse's internal discovery system processes raw `.hyper` files on a fast path but queues `.tdsx` packages for deferred processing
- Updated all Pulse publish calls to use `server.datasources.publish(ds_item, hyper_path, "Overwrite")` instead of `.tdsx`
- Pulse metric `time_dimension` now references raw `Date` column (not calculated `Display Date`)

---

## 2026-06-03 — Viz Field Role Exclusivity + Summary Clarity

### Fixed

**Visualizations: field role exclusivity rule**
- Added a guard to prevent placing the same semantic field in both a grouping slot (dimension/columns) and an aggregation slot (measure/rows) in the same visualization
- This caused charts to silently fail to render — reported by a user whose build needed manual correction
- Rule added to both `build-demo.md` Phase 5 instructions and `CLAUDE.md` Known Pitfalls

### Improved

**Final summary: business preferences callout**
- The post-build summary now explicitly tells the user that Business Preferences are at the end of the walkthrough `.docx` file, includes the full file path, and reminds them where to paste it in the SDM UI

---
## 2026-05-29 — Pulse Goals/Thresholds + HCHSP Demo

### Added

**Pulse goals/thresholds support (data-side + documented manual setup)**
- `METRIC_CONFIG` now supports an optional `goal` dict with `value`, `field`, `name`, `direction`
- Data generation adds constant target columns to the datasource (e.g. `Attendance Target = 0.85`)
- Walkthrough `.docx` includes a "Setting Up Goal Lines" section with field-to-metric mapping table
- Company research step now explicitly calls out finding regulatory thresholds and compliance targets

**Known Pitfall: Pulse `datasource_goals` API is non-functional**
- Tested all payload variations: `basic_specification`, `threshold_basic_specification`, minimal — all return 400 "Invalid request"
- PATCH/PUT on existing definitions also fails
- Workaround: include target columns in datasource + document 2-minute UI setup

**HCHSP (Hidalgo County Head Start Program) demo built**
- 27 campuses across 8 ISDs in Hidalgo County, TX
- Metrics: Attendance Rate (85% federal threshold), Dental Completion, Screening Compliance, Family Referral Rate
- Signal: rural ISDs (Monte Alto, Mercedes, La Joya) declining below federal floor; urban campuses masking the problem
- Full walkthrough `.docx` with federal compliance context (45 CFR citations)

---

## 2026-05-28 — Self-Healing Dates (Tableau Next + Pulse)

### Changed

**Both platforms now use self-healing Display Date formulas — no `/refresh-demo` needed**

The same logic applies to both Tableau Next and Pulse:
```
DATEADD("day", DATEDIFF("day", #<build_date>#, [date_field]), TODAY())
```
Each row's date is shifted forward by the number of days elapsed since the build. `TODAY()` evaluates at query time on both platforms, so the most recent data always appears as "today" automatically.

**Tableau Next**: Self-healing calculated dimension on the SDM. Metrics reference it via `{"calculatedFieldApiName": "Display_Date"}`.

**Pulse**: Self-healing calculated field embedded in a `.tdsx` package (ZIP of `.tds` XML + `.hyper`). Pulse evaluates `TODAY()` fresh on every query because "unstable functions" are excluded from extract materialization.

### Key findings
- SDM calculated dimensions use `#YYYY-MM-DD#` hash-delimited date literals (not `DATE(y,m,d)`)
- Metric `timeDimensionReference` for calc dims must use `calculatedFieldApiName` (not `tableFieldReference`)
- Pulse `.tdsx` calc fields use single quotes: `DATEADD('day', ...)`; SDM uses double quotes
- Tableau Cloud evaluates `TODAY()` at query time for both published extracts and SDM expressions

### Updated files
- `CLAUDE.md` — unified date-shifting rule, new Known Pitfall for `calculatedFieldApiName`
- `.claude/commands/build-demo.md` — Phase 2 documents `.tdsx` packaging; Phase 4 documents self-healing calc dim
- `.claude/commands/refresh-demo.md` — reframed as legacy upgrade tool only
- `OVERVIEW.md` — both platforms documented as self-healing
- `README.md` — Step 5 now says "no action needed"

---

## [Unreleased]

---

## 2026-05-21 — Field Descriptions for AI Optimization

### Added

**Automatic field descriptions on every SDM measurement and dimension**
- `METRIC_CONFIG` entries now carry a `description` field; it is included in the measurement PUT payload (same call as `aggregationType` — no extra round-trip)
- A `DIM_DESCRIPTIONS` dict at the top of each demo script maps dimension field names to plain-language descriptions written for Concierge to read ("Use this field to..." style)
- After DO creation, a loop PUTs descriptions on every filterable dimension via `PUT /services/data/v65.0/ssot/semantic/models/{sdm}/data-objects/{do}/dimensions/{api}`
- Descriptions are generated during the company research phase so they reflect the actual use case and terminology

These descriptions appear in the Tableau Next UI and are the primary signal the Analytics AI Agent uses to understand what each field means. Without them, Concierge cannot accurately answer questions about the data.

---

## 2026-05-21 — Conversational Analytics Principle + TriNet Dimension Expansion

### Added

**Conversational analytics design principle**
- Added a core design principle to both `build-demo.md` and `CLAUDE.md`: every demo must let the audience answer four questions — What is wrong? Where is it worst? Why is it happening? Who is most at risk?
- Dimensions must be designed to support each layer of that conversation, not just produce a chart
- Signal amplification by segment (high-cost plans hit harder, micro clients harder than mid-market, specific regions lead) so filtering feels like discovery, not decoration

**TriNet demo — drillable dimensions**
- Added `plan_cost_tier` (Low/Mid/High) and `workforce_type` (Technical/Administrative/Sales/Mixed) to client generation — with realistic distributions by vertical (Tech/Life Sciences skew High cost; Nonprofits skew Low)
- Added three benefit category metrics: `medical_enrollment_rate`, `dental_enrollment_rate`, `voluntary_plan_enrollment_rate` — with differentiated signal decay (voluntary drops at 1.8× the primary signal, medical at 0.2×) to show cost-sensitive benefits drop first
- All new dimensions denormalized into the fact table so the SDM can filter by them (IngestAPI DLO join workaround)
- Signal now amplified by segment: High-cost tier × 1.5, Micro size × 1.3, Northeast/West regions × 1.2–1.3 — creating a real investigative story
- Dashboard expanded to 3 rows of vizzes (6 total): overall trend, voluntary opt-in, voluntary plan breakdown, medical trend, utilization, satisfaction
- Metric tiles updated to show Benefits Enrollment Rate, Voluntary Opt-in Rate, Voluntary Plan Rate as the three opening KPIs
- `additionalDimensions` on metrics now includes vertical, size_band, region, state, plan_cost_tier, workforce_type

---

## 2026-05-21 — Update Check on Skill Launch

### Added

**Automatic update check in `/build-demo` and `/setup`**
- Both skills now run `git fetch origin main` at startup and compare the remote commit count to the local HEAD
- If the remote is ahead, the user is prompted to pull before continuing, with a summary of what changed (`git log --oneline`)
- If the user declines, the build or setup proceeds with their current version
- Failures (no network, not a git repo) are silently ignored

---

## 2026-05-21 — Autonomous Mode Persisted + TriNet Build Fixes

### Changed

**Autonomous mode is now always on**
- The `allow` block in `.claude/settings.local.json` is no longer removed after each build — autonomous mode persists across sessions
- `/build-demo` no longer asks "would you like to run autonomously?" at the start of each session
- Instead, it notifies the user at build start that autonomous mode is active and explains how to switch to manual mode by typing "manual mode"

### Fixed

**Bulk ingest: daily-grain fact tables were losing all but the last day**
- Root cause: fact stream was created with `client_id` as the sole primary key; `upsert` with a non-unique PK overwrites previous rows, leaving only the final day's data
- Fix: added a `record_id` surrogate key (`date_clientid`, e.g. `2025-05-21_TN-10051`) as the stream PK so each client×day row is unique
- Note: the Bulk Ingest API only supports `upsert` and `delete` — `insert` returns 400

**Rate metrics displayed as decimals instead of percentages**
- CLCs for rate metrics (stored as decimals 0–1) now multiply by 100: `AVG([DO].[field]) * 100`
- Viz format suffix and axis format updated to `%` with 1 decimal place for rate fields
- Non-rate metrics (e.g. satisfaction scores) use a separate format with no suffix
- `METRIC_CONFIG` entries now carry an `is_rate` flag to control CLC expression and viz formatting

**Dashboard container widgets missing from widgets dict**
- Container widgets referenced in the layout's `page_widgets` were not included in the top-level `widgets` dict, causing 500 "Cannot invoke EntityObject.getId()"
- Fix: every widget name in the layout must have a corresponding entry in `widgets` with `type`, `name`, `actions: []`, and `parameters`

**Schema registration always updates existing schemas**
- Phase 1 previously skipped schema registration if the schema name already existed on the connector
- Fix: always PUT the current `FACT_FIELDS`/`DIM_FIELDS` definitions, replacing stale schemas — ensures new fields (e.g. `record_id`) are picked up without manual cleanup

### Added (CLAUDE.md pitfalls)

- Bulk Ingest: only `upsert` and `delete` are valid operations; `insert` returns 400
- Bulk Ingest: daily-grain fact tables need a surrogate `record_id` PK (`date_clientid`)
- Schema registration: PUT always replaces — don't skip if schema already exists when fields have changed
- Dashboard: all widget names in the layout must have entries in the `widgets` dict, including containers
- Dashboard widget entries need `actions: []`, `name`, `type`, `source`, and `parameters`

---

## 2026-05-14 — Retry Cleanup Extended to Workspace + SDM

### Fixed

**Stale SDMs and workspaces from failed runs**
- Extended the retry cleanup pattern (previously applied only to vizzes/dashboards in phase 6) to the workspace and SDM creation phase (phase 4)
- `all_ws_apis` and `all_sdm_apis` are now tracked in the checkpoint alongside `all_viz_apis` and `all_dash_apis`
- At the start of each phase 4 run, all previously created workspaces and SDMs in those lists are deleted before new ones are created, preventing accumulation of stale assets across retries
- Derived checkpoint keys (`ws_api`, `sdm_api`, `do_api`) are cleared before recreation so the phase always starts clean

---

## 2026-05-14 — Business Preferences, Brand Colors, Retry Cleanup, Advanced Mode

### Added

**Business Preferences for Tableau Next SDMs**
- The build now generates SDM-level Business Preferences text tailored to the company and use case — structured as `#`-prefixed instruction lines covering entity context, leading vs. lagging indicators, diagnostic dimensions, terminology, and time comparison defaults
- Text is saved to the checkpoint, included as a dedicated "Business Preferences (SDM)" section in the concierge walkthrough `.docx`, and printed in the final summary with a clear callout to paste it into the SDM manually
- Note: there is no public REST API for this field — it must be set in the UI (Data 360 → Semantic Model → [SDM] → AI Optimization → Manage Business Preferences)

**Brand Colors for Tableau Next dashboards**
- `/build-demo` now asks whether to use brand colors when building a Tableau Next demo for a real company
- If yes, Claude researches the company's brand guidelines and applies a `BRAND` dict (primary, secondary, chart_bg, text, dash_bg) to dashboard background/gutter and visualization shading/fonts
- Dark primary colors are automatically tinted: each channel blended 90% toward 255 (e.g. `#033C5A` → `#E6F1F6`)
- If no, or for fictitious companies, defaults to `#F3F3F3` background and `#2E2E2E` text

**Advanced Mode for `/build-demo`**
- Optional mode unlocked at the start of each session — never saved to config
- Configures four parameters per build:
  - **History length** — 6 / 12 / 24 (default) / 36 months
  - **Time grain** — daily / weekly / monthly (default); warns on daily + 36 months combination
  - **Signal design** (per primary metric) — severity (15% / 25% / 40% / custom), onset (−3 / −6 / −9 months), and shape (ramp / accelerating / step)
  - **Supporting metric strength** — subtle (8%) / moderate (12% default) / strong (18%)

**Cross-org OAuth error handling in `/setup`**
- Added two new troubleshooting blocks to the Salesforce OAuth browser flow step:
  - `invalid_client_id`: app not yet activated — wait 2–10 minutes and retry
  - `Cross-org OAuth flows are not supported`: browser is logged into the wrong org — sign out of all Salesforce sessions, log back into the target org, then retry

### Fixed

**Retry cleanup for Tableau Next phase 6**
- Vizzes and dashboards created during failed phase 6 runs are now tracked in `cp["all_viz_apis"]` and `cp["all_dash_apis"]` in the checkpoint
- At the start of each phase 6 run, all previously created assets in those lists are deleted before new ones are created
- These lists are never cleared on phase reset — they survive across retries so stale assets from any prior run are always cleaned up
- Safety rule: Claude will only delete assets that appear in those checkpoint lists; any other deletion requires explicit user confirmation

**VizQL visualization format**
- Rewrote `make_viz` to use the correct VizQL format: `layout: "Vizql"`, columns/rows as field-key arrays, all required top-level and style keys present
- Fixed series of 400 errors from missing required fields: `encodings`, `headers` (style + marks), `legends`, `lines`, `marks.panes`
- `style.marks.headers` now uses the `_marks_headers_style()` pattern
- `marks.panes` is a direct object specifying the chart type, not nested under `default`
- `style.lines` uses explicit keys — `{"referenceLines": {}}` is invalid
- `legends` is required at the top level of `visualSpecification`; use `{}` when no color dimension

**DLO status polling**
- Fixed status field path: `body.get("dataLakeObjectInfo", {}).get("status") or body.get("status", "UNKNOWN")` — the top-level `status` field is not always present
- Added 30-second post-ACTIVE wait before submitting bulk ingest jobs to allow schema propagation

## 2026-05-12 — Initial Release

### Added

- **`/setup`** — guided one-time configuration wizard for Tableau Cloud (PAT) and Salesforce (OAuth + Data Cloud); discovers or creates an Ingest API connector; supports multiple named profiles in `config.json`
- **`/build-demo`** — story-driven demo builder with three output modes:
  - **Tableau Pulse** — publishes `.hyper` datasource, creates Pulse metric definitions with correct granularities, creates a group, and subscribes it to all metrics
  - **Tableau Next** — pushes data to Data Cloud via Bulk Ingest API, builds a Semantic Data Model with relationships, calculated measurements, and metrics, then creates visualizations and a dashboard
  - **CSV export** — exports the generated dataset for use in any viz tool
- **Synthetic data generation** — 24 months of history, one row per entity per month, with an engineered signal ramp over the last 6 months
- **Concierge walkthrough `.docx`** — generated automatically with ordered Concierge prompts and talking points for each demo
- **Checkpoint/resume** — each build writes a `{slug}_checkpoint.json` after each phase so interrupted runs can resume without re-ingesting data or re-creating assets
- **`connections.py`** — centralized auth module; all demo scripts import from here, never inline credentials
- **`config.json.template`** — safe-to-commit template showing required credential fields
