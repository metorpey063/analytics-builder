# /build-demo — AIO Analytics Builder Demo Generator

Build a complete demo for a prospect or use case. This command generates synthetic data with an engineered story signal, then lets you choose which outputs to create.

---

## Core design principle — conversational analytics

**The goal is never just a chart. The goal is a problem the audience can solve.**

Every demo must be designed so the presenter can walk through a sequence of questions with the audience:

1. **What is wrong?** — The primary metric drops visibly. The audience sees it in 10 seconds.
2. **Where is it worst?** — Filtering by Vertical, Region, or Size Band reveals which segment is driving the decline.
3. **Why is it happening?** — Category breakdowns (e.g. Voluntary plan enrollment drops before overall enrollment) and supporting metrics explain the cause.
4. **Who is most at risk?** — Dimensions like Plan Cost Tier, Workforce Type, or State identify specific clients or groups to act on.

When designing data for a demo, always ask: *"Can the audience answer all four questions using only the filters and metrics I've built?"* If not, add dimensions until they can.

**Dimension rules:**
- Denormalize all categorical dimensions into the fact table — IngestAPI DLO joins silently drop criteria (see CLAUDE.md Known Pitfalls). Every filterable field must be a column on the fact row.
- Include at least one *cost/effort* dimension (Plan Cost Tier, Deal Size, Spend Bucket) — this is almost always the root cause the audience cares most about.
- Include at least one *who/where* dimension set (Region, Vertical, Size Band, State).
- Include category breakdowns that decompose the primary metric — e.g. Medical vs Dental vs Voluntary enrollment, or New Logo vs Expansion vs Renewal revenue.

**Signal rules:**
- Amplify the primary signal differently by segment so filtering *reveals the story*: e.g. High-cost clients drop hardest, Micro clients harder than Mid-Market, specific verticals or regions lead the trend. This makes filtering feel like discovery.
- Supporting metrics should lag the primary signal slightly — they answer *why* after the audience has already seen *what*.

## Prerequisites

### For Tableau Pulse builds
Run `/setup` first. All connections must show OK before building a demo.

### For Tableau Next builds (allow 1–2 hours before starting)

Before running `/setup` or `/build-demo` for a Tableau Next demo, the Salesforce org must be provisioned and configured. This takes time — start this process well before your demo session.

**Step 1 — Get a demo org**
- Request a **CDO (Clean Demo Org)** or **SDO (Standard Demo Org)** from your SE resources
- Wait for the provisioning email

**Step 2 — Activate the org**
- Confirm your email address from the provisioning email
- Log in and change your password

**Step 3 — Enable Data Cloud**
- Go to **Data Cloud Setup** in the App Launcher
- Click the button to start the Data Cloud setup wizard and complete it

**Step 4 — Enable Tableau Next**
- Go to **Salesforce Setup** (gear icon → Setup)
- Search for **Tableau** in the Quick Find box
- Open the Tableau Next setup guide and complete through **Step 4**

Once all four steps are done, run `/setup` to connect your credentials and then come back here to build the demo.

## What this builds

Based on your inputs, the demo builder will:

1. **Generate synthetic data** — realistic monthly data for your chosen use case with an engineered signal (a deliberate metric decline that tells a story)
2. Let you choose one or more **output modes**:

| Mode | What gets built |
|------|----------------|
| **Pulse** | Publishes a .hyper datasource to Tableau Cloud, creates Pulse metric definitions, creates a group, subscribes the group to all metrics |
| **Tableau Next** | Pushes data to Salesforce Data Cloud, builds a Semantic Data Model, creates metrics and calculated fields, creates visualizations and a dashboard |
| **CRMA** | Uploads dataset to CRM Analytics (Wave), creates a dashboard with SAQL-driven charts, KPI numbers, and dimension filters |
| **CSV Export** | Exports the generated dataset as a CSV file in the `demos/` folder |

---

## How to run

When you invoke `/build-demo`, Claude will ask you the following questions one at a time. You don't need to have all answers ready — work through them conversationally.

### -2. New or existing demo?

**Ask this first, before the update check.**

> "Are you starting a **new demo build**, or would you like to **pick up where you left off** on an existing one?"

- If **new**: continue to the update check and full build flow.
- If **existing / resume**: check `sessions/` in the memory directory for demo session summaries. List any that match (by company name, use case, or recency). Load the relevant summary and present the state:
  - What was built (metrics, assets, output modes)
  - What the user mentioned wanting to add/change
  - Any open issues from last time
  - Then ask: "What would you like to do next — add metrics, tweak the data, rebuild a specific phase, or something else?"
  - Use the checkpoint file referenced in the session summary to skip already-completed phases.

### -1. Pulse API validation (weekly, automatic)

**For Pulse builds only.** Before the update check, run the canary validator if it's due:

```python
from pulse_validator import should_run_validation, run_validation, get_last_validation_status

if should_run_validation():
    print("Running weekly Pulse API validation against canary pod (10ax)...")
    passed, failed, results = run_validation(quiet=False)
    if failed > 0:
        print("\n⚠ Pulse API validation failed — the payload format may have changed on the canary pod.")
        print("  This means a breaking change is coming to your site soon.")
        print("  Review the failures above and update the payload format before proceeding.")
        # Ask user whether to continue or abort
else:
    state = get_last_validation_status()
    if state:
        print(f"  Pulse API: validated {state['passed']}/{state['passed']+state['failed']} on {state['version']} ({state['last_run'][:10]})")
```

The validator runs against `10ax.online.tableau.com` (first pod to receive each release). If it detects failures, it means a breaking payload change is imminent — fix the format before it hits production pods.

Triggers: runs if (a) it's been 7+ days since last run, or (b) the canary pod's build version changed.

### -1b. Update check

**Do this before anything else on a new build.**

First, check if this is a git repo connected to the remote:

```bash
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2>/dev/null && git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null
```

**If either fails** (not a git repo, or no remote configured — common for ZIP downloads), auto-connect:

```bash
git init 2>/dev/null
git remote remove origin 2>/dev/null
git remote add origin https://github.com/metorpey063/AIO-Analytics-Builder.git
git fetch origin main
git reset --hard origin/main
```

Tell the user:
> "I've connected this project to the AIO Analytics Builder repository and pulled the latest code. You're all set."

Then continue to Step 0 (autonomous mode) — the hard reset already applied the update.

**If git is set up and remote exists**, check for updates:

```bash
git fetch origin main 2>/dev/null && git rev-list HEAD..origin/main --count
```

- If the command fails (no network) — skip silently and continue.
- If the result is `0` — skip silently and continue.
- If the result is **1 or more** — apply the update automatically:

```bash
git stash push -m "pre-update-stash" -- config.json discovered_fixes.md 2>/dev/null
git reset --hard origin/main
git stash pop 2>/dev/null
```

Tell the user:
> "Updated to the latest version (`N` new commits applied)."

Show: `git log HEAD~N..HEAD --oneline`

Then continue the build as normal.

### 0. Autonomous mode

**Autonomous mode is always on** — the `allow` block is already present in `.claude/settings.local.json`. Do not ask whether to enable it, and do not remove it after the build completes.

At the very start of every `/build-demo` run, before any other output, tell the user:

> "Running in autonomous mode — I'll execute scripts and read files without asking for confirmation. To turn this off, type **manual mode** at any time and I'll switch to asking before each step."

If the user types "manual mode" during the build, pause before every Bash and Read, describe what you're about to do, and wait for confirmation. Do not remove the `allow` block from `settings.local.json` even in manual mode — just change your own behavior.

### 1. Company name
Ask the user for the company name, and include this note when asking:

> "If this is a real company, I can research their industry, product lines, regions, and go-to-market model to make the demo data and story much more relevant — real segment names, realistic deal sizes, accurate geographies. If it's a fictitious company, the demo will still be compelling but more generic. Real company = better demo."

Use the answer to determine how much research to do in the Company Research step — real company gets web searches, fictitious company gets reasonable industry defaults.

### 1b. Supporting materials
Immediately after the company name, ask:

> "Do you have any notes, documents, or context you'd like to share to help refine the demo? For example: call notes, a brief, a discovery deck, an email thread, specific metrics they care about, or any files I can read. This is optional — I'll also do my own research — but anything you provide will make the demo more tailored. (paste text, drag in a file, or skip)"

- If the user provides text, a file path, or drags in a document: read and incorporate the content into the Company Research phase. Extract any mentioned metrics, dimensions, personas, pain points, goals, or terminology and use them to inform all subsequent steps.
- If the user says **skip** or similar: proceed without additional context.

This step is especially valuable for real customer demos where the SE has call notes, a discovery brief, or specific asks from the account team.

### 1c. Research depth (only for real companies)

Ask the user:

> "How much research should I do on {Company}?
> 1. **Quick** (~2-3 minutes) — basic company info, industry, key regions. Good if you already know the account well or are short on time.
> 2. **Detailed** (~10-15 minutes) — deep dive into their business model, industry benchmarks, regulatory targets, brand colors, competitor context. Produces the most realistic demo data."

- If **Quick**: the background research agent does 2-3 focused searches (company overview, industry benchmarks for the use case). Prompt the agent to return results within 3 minutes. Limit to essentials: company size/industry, real region/segment names, baseline metric ranges.
- If **Detailed**: the background research agent does 5-7 searches covering all five research areas (company itself, industry benchmarks, use-case context, goals/thresholds, brand guidelines). Allow the agent full time to be thorough.

**For fictitious companies**: skip this question entirely — no research needed, use reasonable industry defaults.

**Launch the research agent immediately after this answer** (don't wait for use case/persona questions). Use `run_in_background: true`.

### 2. Use case / industry
What business problem are we telling a story about? Examples:
- Corporate travel compliance declining
- Hotel booking revenue at risk
- Loan originations falling in a specific region
- Customer churn in subscription services
- Operational cost overruns in logistics

### 3. Persona
Who is the primary viewer of this demo? (e.g. VP of Finance, Chief Revenue Officer, Head of Operations). This shapes which metrics matter most.

### 4. Story signal
What is the "uh oh" moment in the data? The signal is a deliberately engineered decline that creates urgency. Examples:
- Bookings through the platform down 18% over last 6 months
- Off-platform spend increasing in a specific region
- Net Promoter Score declining among enterprise accounts

### 4b. Primary metric(s)
Which 1–2 metrics carry the story? These are the ones the demo click path leads with — they get a strong, obvious signal that any viewer can see at a glance.

The remaining metrics are **supporting context**: they show correlated movement (e.g. issues up when CSAT is down) but their signal is softer. They answer "why" when the audience digs in, but they don't compete for attention up front.

Examples:
- Primary: CSAT Score. Supporting: Issues Reported, Resolution Hours, Platform Booking Rate
- Primary: Platform Booking Rate. Supporting: CSAT Score, NPS Score
- Primary: Loan Origination Volume. Supporting: Approval Rate, Time-to-Close

**Signal design rule:**
- Primary metric: exaggerate for storytelling impact — a 25–40% drop over 6 months creates a clear "uh oh" moment that's unmissable in a sparkline. Real-world anomalies of 5–10% matter operationally but don't land in a demo. The goal is to make the audience say "wow, something is clearly wrong here" within the first 10 seconds.
- Supporting metrics: softer correlated drift — 8–15% movement is enough to tell a causal story when the audience digs in, without stealing attention from the primary signal.
- The ramp should be smooth (use the `signal_ramp` function), not a sudden cliff — a gradual deterioration looks like a real emerging problem, not synthetic data.

Apply this when generating the data and when writing the walkthrough document — the demo flow should always open on the primary metric and use supporting metrics only to answer follow-up questions.

### 4c. Advanced mode

Ask after the primary metrics are decided:

> "Would you like to use **Advanced Mode**? This lets you fine-tune the data history length, time grain, and signal parameters for each metric. Recommended if you have a specific audience or storytelling style in mind. (yes / no)"

- If **no**: skip to Step 5. Use defaults: 24 months history, monthly grain, standard signal ramp.
- If **yes**: ask the following questions one at a time before proceeding to Step 5.

Advanced mode is asked fresh each session — never saved to config.

---

**A. Data history length**

> "How much historical data should the demo show?
> 1. **6 months** — tight, recent story; good for fast-moving metrics like pipeline or NPS
> 2. **12 months** — one full year; shows seasonality and a clean year-over-year comparison
> 3. **24 months** — default; enough history to make the signal look like a real emerging trend
> 4. **36 months** — long view; good for strategic/executive audiences who think in multi-year cycles"

Store as `HISTORY_MONTHS` (6 / 12 / 24 / 36). Default if not asked: 24.

---

**B. Time grain**

> "What time grain should the data use?
> 1. **Daily** — granular; good for operational metrics (support tickets, transactions, outreach response time). Warning: generates a lot of rows — works best with 6–12 months of history.
> 2. **Weekly** — balanced; good for sales pipeline, engagement metrics, or anything reviewed in weekly standups
> 3. **Monthly** — default; cleanest sparklines in Tableau Pulse and Next; recommended for executive and strategic demos"

Store as `GRAIN` (daily / weekly / monthly). Use `freq='D'`, `'W'`, or `'MS'` in `pd.date_range` accordingly. Default if not asked: monthly.

If the user picks **daily + 36 months**, warn them:
> "That combination will generate a very large dataset (~1,000+ rows per entity). I'd recommend 12 months for daily grain, or switching to weekly if you need the longer history. Would you like to adjust?"

---

**C. Signal design — per primary metric**

Run through C1, C2, C3 for each primary metric in turn.

**C1 — Severity**
> "How dramatic should the decline in **[metric name]** appear in the sparkline?
> 1. **Subtle** (~15% drop) — early warning signs; good for 'we caught it early' stories
> 2. **Moderate** (~25% drop) — clear downward trend; unmissable but not alarming
> 3. **Severe** (~40% drop) — crisis-level signal; maximises urgency and the 'uh oh' reaction
> 4. **Custom** — I'll tell you the exact percentage"

Store as `signal_magnitude` (0.15 / 0.25 / 0.40 / custom float). Default if not asked: 0.37.

**C2 — Onset**
> "When should the decline start?
> 1. **6 months ago** — default; decline is clearly visible in the most recent sparkline period
> 2. **3 months ago** — very recent; makes the story feel urgent and unresolved
> 3. **9 months ago** — longer trend; good for 'this has been building for a while' narratives"

Store as `signal_onset` (-6 / -3 / -9). Default if not asked: -6.

**C3 — Shape**
> "How should the decline unfold?
> 1. **Gradual ramp** — default; smooth linear decline that looks like a real emerging problem
> 2. **Slow then accelerating** — flat for a while, then drops sharply at the end; good for 'tipping point' stories
> 3. **Step change** — one visible drop then levels off; good for 'something changed in the business' narratives (e.g. a product launch, a policy change)"

Store as `signal_shape` (ramp / accelerating / step). Default if not asked: ramp.

Implement the shapes in the `signal_ramp` function:
- **ramp**: `min(1.0, (months_from_onset) / duration)` — current default
- **accelerating**: `min(1.0, ((months_from_onset) / duration) ** 2)` — quadratic curve
- **step**: `1.0 if months_from_onset >= duration * 0.3 else 0.0` — drop at 30% through the window then flat

---

**D. Supporting metric signal strength**

> "How clearly should the supporting metrics move in the data?
> 1. **Subtle** (~8% movement) — barely perceptible; lets the primary signal dominate completely
> 2. **Moderate** (~12% movement) — default; visible on closer inspection, tells a causal story
> 3. **Strong** (~18% movement) — clearly correlated; good if you want the audience to connect the dots quickly"

Store as `supporting_magnitude` (0.08 / 0.12 / 0.18). Default if not asked: 0.12.

---

**Applying advanced settings in the script:**

Define all advanced parameters near the top of the script, clearly grouped:

```python
# ── Advanced settings ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
HISTORY_MONTHS        = 24       # 6 / 12 / 24 / 36
GRAIN                 = "monthly"  # daily / weekly / monthly
SIGNAL_MAGNITUDE      = 0.37    # primary metric decline (fraction)
SIGNAL_ONSET          = -6      # months before today when decline starts
SIGNAL_SHAPE          = "ramp"  # ramp / accelerating / step
SUPPORTING_MAGNITUDE  = 0.12    # supporting metric movement (fraction)
```

Update the `signal_ramp` function to accept `onset`, `shape`, and `duration` parameters. Update date range generation to use `HISTORY_MONTHS` and `GRAIN`. Print a summary of all advanced settings at the start of each script run.

---

### 5. Output mode
Choose one or more:
- `pulse` — Tableau Pulse metrics
- `next` — Tableau Next + Data Cloud
- `crma` — CRM Analytics (Wave) dataset + dashboard
- `csv` — CSV export only
- `all` — all of the above

### 5a. Dashboard follow-up (only if output is `pulse`)

When the user selects `pulse` as the output mode, immediately follow up:

> "Would you like me to also create a Tableau Dashboard with charts and embedded Pulse metric tiles? (yes / no)"

- If **yes**: include the Tableau Dashboard phase (Phase 5 in the Pulse build process) using `twb_builder.py`
- If **no**: skip the dashboard phase entirely

This question is asked during the input-gathering phase (before the build starts), not after the build completes.

### 5b. Brand colors (only ask if output includes `next` or `all`, and only for real companies)

> "Would you like me to look up {Company}'s brand guidelines and apply their official colors to the Tableau Next dashboard? (yes / no)"

- If **yes**: include brand color research as step 4 of the Company Research section (search `{Company} brand guidelines color palette`). Define a `BRAND` dict at the top of the script and apply colors to the dashboard background, gutter, and viz shading/fonts as described in the Brand colors section below.
- If **no**: skip brand research entirely. Use the default neutral palette (`dash_bg: "#F3F3F3"`, `chart_bg: "#FFFFFF"`, `text: "#2E2E2E"`) and omit the `BRAND` dict from the script.

Do not ask this question for fictitious companies or for CSV/Pulse-only builds.

---

## Token limits

Demo scripts are long — writing one from scratch can hit Claude's output token limit mid-write. When this happens:

> "I've hit the output token limit while generating the script. To avoid this in future sessions, go to **Claude Code → Settings → Max output tokens** and increase it to 32000 or higher. For now, I'll split the remaining script into smaller sections and write them in sequence."

The current project is configured with `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=16384` in `.claude/settings.local.json`. To permanently raise it:
1. Open `.claude/settings.local.json`
2. Change `"CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS": "16384"` to `"CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS": "32000"`

When writing a demo script and the limit is low, break the write into 4 sequential chunks:
- **Chunk 1**: Header, imports, parameters, auth, data generation
- **Chunk 2**: Pulse phases (hyper file, metric creation, group subscription)
- **Chunk 3**: Next phases 1–5 (schema, streams, DLO wait, bulk ingest, ingest polling)
- **Chunk 4**: Next phases 6–10 (workspace, SDM, measurements, metrics, vizzes, dashboard, docs, summary)

Each chunk appends to the file — create it with `Write` on chunk 1, then use `Edit` to append for chunks 2–4.

## Company research (launch in background, don't block the user)

**CRITICAL: All web searches and research MUST happen inside a background Agent — NEVER in the main conversation.** The user should never see WebFetch or WebSearch tool calls scrolling through their session. The main conversation is for asking questions and showing results — research happens silently in the background.

**Timing:** Launch the research agent AFTER the user answers Step 1c (research depth — Quick vs Detailed). Do NOT launch before asking the depth question. The depth answer determines how many searches the agent does. After launching, continue asking the remaining questions (use case, persona, signal, metrics, advanced mode, output mode) without waiting for the agent to finish.

**Why:** Research takes 30-90 seconds. The user can answer 5-6 questions in that time. By the time all inputs are collected and you're ready to write the data generation script, the research results will be available. This eliminates the dead wait.

**Rules:**
- NEVER call WebFetch or WebSearch directly in the main conversation
- ALWAYS delegate research to a background Agent with `run_in_background: true`
- The user's experience should be a smooth Q&A flow with no interruptions
- When the background agent completes, incorporate its findings silently into the data generation — don't replay the research to the user unless they ask

**Pattern:**
```
1. User says "Acme Corp" → launch background research agent immediately
2. Continue asking: use case? persona? signal? primary metrics? advanced? output?
3. By step 5 (output mode), research agent has completed
4. Use research results when writing the data generation code
```

**If research hasn't returned yet** by the time you need it (rare — only if the user answers very fast), wait for it at that point. The key is: never block early when you can block late.

Before generating numbers, spend 3–4 web searches to ground the demo in reality:

1. **The company itself** — industry, primary product lines, go-to-market model (direct/channel/PLG), typical customer segments, notable regions or markets
2. **Industry benchmarks for the use case** — e.g. for sales: average win rates by segment (Enterprise ~20–25%, SMB ~30–40%), typical sales cycle lengths, realistic quota sizes and attainment distributions (median attainment ~80–100%, top quartile ~120–140%, rarely >150%)
3. **Any use-case-specific context** — e.g. for a hotel chain: actual property categories they operate (full-service, select-service, extended-stay), real regions/markets they operate in, realistic ADR and occupancy ranges
4. **Goals, thresholds, and compliance targets** — search for regulatory requirements, SLA commitments, or industry-standard targets that define "good" vs "bad" for this company's metrics. Examples: federal 85% attendance (Head Start), 99.9% uptime SLA, 30-day close rate target, NPS > 40, 95% screening compliance. These become goal lines on Pulse sparklines and make the demo viscerally urgent.
5. **Brand guidelines** — search `{Company} brand guidelines color palette` to find official hex codes for primary and secondary brand colors. Most large companies publish these on their communications or marketing sites.

Use these findings to:
- Name dimensions with real values (real regions, real product lines, real customer segments) not generic placeholders like "Region A"
- Set base metric values and noise ranges that match industry norms
- Write story talking points that reference the company's actual business context
- **Define goal/threshold values** for each metric and include constant target columns in the datasource (e.g. `Attendance Target = 0.85`) — these enable one-click goal setup in the Pulse UI
- Apply brand colors in the Tableau Next dashboard (see Brand colors section below)

### Brand colors (Tableau Next only — only if user said yes in step 5b)

After finding the brand colors, define a `BRAND` dict at the top of the script with primary, secondary, and background colors:

```python
BRAND = {
    "primary":    "#XXXXXX",   # dominant brand color — used for dashboard background tint
    "secondary":  "#XXXXXX",   # accent color — used for shading/banding
    "chart_bg":   "#FFFFFF",   # almost always white
    "text":       "#2E2E2E",   # body text — use dark brand color if available, else near-black
}
```

Apply these colors in the dashboard and visualizations:
- **Dashboard `style.backgroundColor`** and **`style.gutterColor`**: use a light tint of the primary brand color. If the primary is dark (e.g. navy), compute a ~10% tint: mix toward white (`mix(primary, #FFFFFF, 0.10)` logic — do this manually from the hex). If the brand palette includes an explicit light/background color, use it directly.
- **Viz `style.shading.backgroundColor`**: set to `BRAND["chart_bg"]` (usually `#FFFFFF`)
- **Viz `FONTS`**: set `color` fields to `BRAND["text"]`

**Tint formula** (for dark primaries — when primary luminance is below 50%):
Take the primary hex, blend each channel 90% toward 255: `tint = hex(round(channel + (255 - channel) * 0.90))`. E.g. `#033C5A` → `#E6F1F6`.

If brand colors cannot be found after searching, fall back to a neutral light gray (`#F3F3F3`) for backgrounds and `#2E2E2E` for text — never leave placeholder hex codes in the script.

**Realistic base values (healthy period):**
- Quota attainment: 88–102% is realistic for a healthy team; the signal drop should bring it to 60–75% — painful but not apocalyptic
- Win rates: 18–28% Enterprise, 28–38% Commercial, 35–48% SMB for SaaS
- Sales cycle: 90–120 days Enterprise, 30–60 days Commercial, 7–21 days SMB
- CSAT: 4.1–4.5/5.0 is healthy; decline target 3.5–3.8
- NPS: 35–55 is good for SaaS; decline target 15–25
- Revenue: calibrate deal_count × avg_deal_size to land within 5% of monthly_quota in healthy months
- Percentages: always store as decimals (0.35 not 35)

**Signal magnitude (engineered, not realistic):**
- Primary metrics: 25–40% decline over 6 months — exaggerate for visual impact, this is a demo not a forecast
- Supporting metrics: 10–18% decline — corroborating but not competing for attention
- The base (pre-signal) period should look stable with mild noise, so the decline reads as a clear inflection

Always sanity-check: print the min/max/mean of derived metrics (e.g. quota attainment) before finalising the data generation code. If anything looks implausible, recalibrate the base values.

## Build process

### For Pulse output (flow-first approach):

**Phase 1 — Data generation**
- Create a DataFrame: 24 months of history, one row per entity per month
- Engineer the signal: metric declines over the last 6 months using a ramp function
- All percentages stored as decimals (0.35 not 35)
- Column names business-friendly with spaces and proper caps

**Phase 2 — Publish self-healing datasource (no Prep flow needed)**

The self-healing pattern uses a two-step publish:
1. Publish `.hyper` with a stored `Date` column → Pulse indexes it immediately
2. After metrics are created (Phase 3), overwrite with `.tdsx` containing calc `Date = DATEADD('day', [Day_Offset], TODAY())` → self-heals forever, no scheduling

```python
from tdsx_builder import publish_hyper_for_indexing, convert_to_self_healing

# Connect via PAT
server, auth_token, site_id = get_tableau_token(config)

# Clean up existing project/datasource with same company name
# Create timestamped project: {Company} | {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}

# Step 2a: Publish .hyper (indexes immediately, stored Date for metric creation)
ds_luid = publish_hyper_for_indexing(
    df=fact_df,
    date_column="Date",
    datasource_name=f"{COMPANY} - {USE_CASE_LABEL}",
    project_id=project_id,
    server=server,
    output_dir=SCRIPT_DIR,
)
# Save ds_luid to checkpoint — metrics will reference this
```

**CRITICAL SEQUENCE:** Create metrics (Phase 3) IMMEDIATELY after this step, BEFORE converting to self-healing. The metrics need the stored `Date` field to exist during creation. After metrics are created, THEN convert:

```python
# Step 2b: AFTER all metrics are created (Phase 3 complete), convert to self-healing
tdsx_path = convert_to_self_healing(
    df=fact_df,
    date_column="Date",
    datasource_name=f"{COMPANY} - {USE_CASE_LABEL}",
    project_id=project_id,
    server=server,
    output_dir=SCRIPT_DIR,
)
# Metrics survive — LUID preserved, calc Date resolves as "Date"
# No Prep flow. No scheduling. No maintenance. Self-heals forever.
```

**How it works:**
- The `.hyper` publishes with a stored `Date` column so Pulse can index it and discover the field
- Metrics are created against this indexed `Date` field
- The `.tdsx` overwrite replaces the stored `Date` with a calculated field of the same name (`name='[Date]'`)
- Because the LUID is preserved (Overwrite mode), all metrics stay bound
- `TODAY()` is an unstable function — Tableau re-evaluates it on every query, so dates slide forward automatically
- No refresh, no flow, no scheduling — the demo stays fresh forever

**Fallback:** If the `.tdsx` overwrite fails for any reason, the `.hyper` with stored dates is still live and working — metrics are unaffected. You can retry the overwrite later or fall back to the old Prep flow approach (`prep_flow_builder.py` is still available).

**Phase 3 — Create Pulse metrics**
- POST each metric to `/api/-/pulse/definitions` using the **2026.2 required payload format**:
  ```python
  payload = {
      "name": f"{COMPANY} - {mc['label']}",
      "description": mc["why_it_matters"],
      "specification": {
          "datasource": {"id": ds_item.id},
          "basic_specification": {
              "measure": {"field": mc["label"], "aggregation": mc["pulse_agg"]},
              "time_dimension": {"field": "Date"},
              "filters": [],
          },
          "is_running_total": mc["pulse_agg"] == "AGGREGATION_SUM",
      },
      "extension_options": {
          "allowed_dimensions": DIMENSIONS,
          "allowed_granularities": GRANULARITIES,
          "offset_from_today": 0,
          "correlation_candidate_definition_ids": [],
          "use_dynamic_offset": False,
      },
      "representation_options": {
          "type": fmt,  # NUMBER_FORMAT_TYPE_NUMBER or _CURRENCY
          "sentiment_type": mc["sentiment"],  # SENTIMENT_TYPE_UP_IS_GOOD / _DOWN_IS_GOOD
      },
      "insights_options": {"show_insights": True, "settings": []},
      "comparisons": {"comparisons": [
          {"compare_config": {"comparison": "TIME_COMPARISON_PREVIOUS_PERIOD", "comparison_period_override": []}, "index": "0"},
      ]},
  }
  ```
- **Required fields in 2026.2**: `extension_options`, `insights_options`, `comparisons` — omitting any returns 400
- **`allowed_dimensions` format**: must be a flat list of field name strings — `["Region", "Program Type"]`. Using objects like `[{"field": "Region"}]` causes 400 with no detail.
- **Validation rules**: `AGGREGATION_AVERAGE` requires `is_running_total: false`; `NUMBER_FORMAT_TYPE_PERCENTAGE` cannot be used with `AGGREGATION_SUM`; sentiment must use SCREAMING_SNAKE format (`SENTIMENT_TYPE_UP_IS_GOOD`)
- **Rate metrics**: use `NUMBER_FORMAT_TYPE_NUMBER` (not PERCENTAGE) with `AGGREGATION_AVERAGE` and `is_running_total: false`
- **Flow metrics**: use `NUMBER_FORMAT_TYPE_NUMBER` or `_CURRENCY` with `AGGREGATION_SUM` and `is_running_total: true`
- **Parse the creation response correctly** — the response wraps under `"definition"`:
  ```python
  resp = r.json()
  def_id = resp["definition"]["metadata"]["id"]
  metric_id = resp["definition"]["metrics"][0]["id"]  # No separate GET needed!
  ```
  Do NOT use `resp.get("metadata", {}).get("id")` — that returns None (no top-level `metadata`).
- PATCH `use_dynamic_offset: true` separately after creation
- Subscribe group using: `{"metric_id": "...", "followers": [{"group_id": "..."}]}` (flat format, NOT the old `"subscriptions"` wrapper)
- Include at minimum GRANULARITY_BY_MONTH, GRANULARITY_BY_QUARTER, GRANULARITY_BY_YEAR

**Phase 3b — Goals / Thresholds (manual setup, auto-documented)**

Pulse goals cannot be set programmatically via the REST API (`datasource_goals` field always returns 400 "Invalid request" regardless of payload format). However, the datasource CAN include pre-computed target columns that make goal setup trivial in the UI.

**During data generation:**
- Add a constant target column for each metric that has a known threshold (e.g. `Attendance Target = 0.85`, `Dental Target = 0.90`)
- Include these columns in the `.hyper` file so they appear as fields in Pulse

**During company research:**
- Look for industry-standard thresholds, regulatory requirements, or internal goals mentioned in the call/brief
- Examples: federal 85% attendance (Head Start), 95% SLA uptime, 30-day close target, NPS > 40
- Store found thresholds in `METRIC_CONFIG` under a `goal` key:
  ```python
  METRIC_CONFIG = [
      {
          'label': 'Attendance Rate',
          'field': 'attendance_rate',
          ...
          'goal': {'value': 0.85, 'field': 'Attendance Target', 'name': 'Federal 85% Threshold', 'direction': 'above'},
      },
  ]
  ```

**In the walkthrough .docx and demo summary:**
- Include a "Setting Up Goal Lines" section with a table mapping each metric to its goal field
- Print clear instructions: open metric → Goals → select field from data → set direction
- This takes under 2 minutes in the UI and creates the visual goal line on sparklines

**Why this matters for the demo:**
- A goal line transforms a sparkline from "interesting" to "urgent" — the audience sees exactly when the metric crosses the threshold
- For compliance-driven organizations (Head Start, healthcare, finance), the threshold IS the story — being 2 points above it is not "fine," it's "dangerously close"

**Phase 4 — Create group and subscribe**
- POST XML to create a group named `{Company} | {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM}`
- POST to `/api/-/pulse/subscriptions:batchCreate` for each metric ID

**Phase 5 — Tableau Dashboard (optional, prompt user)**

After Pulse metrics and group are created, ask:

> "Would you like me to also build a Tableau Dashboard with charts and embedded Pulse metric tiles? This publishes a workbook to the same project with interactive filters and visualizations. (yes / no)"

If **yes**, use `twb_builder.py` to generate and publish a `.twb` workbook:

```python
from twb_builder import build_twb, publish_twb, get_datasource_content_url

# Look up the datasource content_url (Tableau appends a timestamp)
content_url = get_datasource_content_url(
    datasource_name=f"{COMPANY} - {USE_CASE_LABEL}",
    project_id=project_id,
    server=server,
)

tc = config["tableau"]
server_pod = tc["server_url"].replace("https://", "").rstrip("/")

save_checkpoint(cp)
```

**Dashboard layout auto-adapts based on worksheet count:**
- 1 chart: full width
- 2 charts: side by side (50/50)
- 3 charts: 2 on top + 1 full-width bottom
- 4 charts: 2×2 grid (recommended — most balanced)
- 5+ charts: top row of 3 + bottom row with remaining

**Chart selection guidelines:**
- Always include a **horizontal_bar** sorted desc for "who is worst?" (the primary dimension breakdown)
- Always include a **line** or **multi-line** over time for "what's the trend?"
- If the demo has a leading/lagging indicator pair, use **dual_axis** to show the relationship
- If the demo story involves regional/segment divergence, use **multi-line** with `color_field`

**Pulse tile integration:**
- The Pulse metric tiles render as live KPI cards with BAN number, comparison text, and sparkline
- They respond to dashboard filters — filtering by Region updates the tiles automatically
- Requires "Allow Tableau-built extensions" enabled in site settings (Settings → Extensions)
- Uses the same datasource name and Pulse metric IDs from Phase 3

**Important: datasource content_url lookup.**
Tableau Cloud appends a timestamp to the content_url when publishing (e.g. `DineAmic-RestaurantOperations_17872297698210`). The `get_datasource_content_url()` function handles this — never hardcode it.

### For Tableau Next output:

**Auth pattern for ALL Tableau Next phases (CRITICAL):**

Every phase that calls Salesforce/Data Cloud APIs MUST follow this pattern:
```python
# At the START of each phase, reload config (picks up rotated tokens from prior phase)
config = load_config(profile_key=PROFILE_KEY)
sf_token, sf_instance = get_sf_token(config, profile_key=PROFILE_KEY)

# For Data Cloud bulk ingest, also get DC token:
dc_token, dc_domain = get_dc_token(sf_token, sf_instance)
```

**Rules:**
- ALWAYS pass `profile_key` to both `load_config()` and `get_sf_token()` — without it, token rotation saves to the wrong profile
- ALWAYS reload config at the start of each phase — the refresh token may have rotated during the previous phase
- NEVER call `get_sf_token(config)` without `profile_key` — this breaks token rotation persistence
- If you get `400 "expired access/refresh token"`, the token rotated but wasn't saved — re-run `/setup` Step 4b to re-authorize

**Phase 1 — Data generation** (same as above)

**Phase 2 — Register schema + streams**

**Schema registration** — GET existing, strip read-only fields, merge, PUT:
```python
STRIP_FIELDS = {"availabilityStatus", "createdDate", "lastModifiedDate"}
def clean_schema(s):
    return {k: v for k, v in s.items() if k not in STRIP_FIELDS}

r = requests.get(f"{sf_instance}/services/data/v62.0/ssot/connections/{connector_id}/schema", headers=h)
existing_schemas = r.json().get("schemas", []) if r.status_code == 200 else []

new_schema = {"name": schema_name, "label": schema_name, "schemaType": "IngestApi", "fields": FACT_FIELDS}
# FACT_FIELDS: [{"name": "field_name", "label": "Field Label", "dataType": "Text|Number|Date"}, ...]
# Do NOT include isPrimaryKey in schema fields — that only goes in the stream payload

if schema_name in [s["name"] for s in existing_schemas]:
    merged = [clean_schema(s) if s["name"] != schema_name else new_schema for s in existing_schemas]
else:
    merged = [clean_schema(s) for s in existing_schemas] + [new_schema]

r = requests.put(f"{sf_instance}/services/data/v62.0/ssot/connections/{connector_id}/schema",
                 headers=h, json={"schemas": merged})
# Must return 200. Wait 20s for propagation after success.
```

**Stream creation — USE THIS EXACT PAYLOAD FORMAT (do not simplify):**
```python
stream_payload = {
    "name":            schema_name,                    # e.g. "company_fact"
    "label":           schema_name,                    # same as name
    "datasource":      connector_short_name[:10],      # first 10 chars of connector short name
    "datastreamType":  "INGESTAPI",                    # REQUIRED — exactly this string
    "connectorInfo": {
        "connectorType":    "IngestApi",
        "connectorDetails": {
            "name": connector_uuid_name,               # the full UUID name from config
            "events": [schema_name]                    # array with the schema name
        },
    },
    "dataLakeObjectInfo": {                            # REQUIRED — entire block
        "label":    schema_name,
        "category": "Other",
        "dataspaceInfo": [{"name": "default"}],        # REQUIRED — must be "default"
        "dataLakeFieldInputRepresentations": [
            {"name": "record_id", "label": "record_id", "dataType": "Text", "isPrimaryKey": True}
        ],
        "eventDateTimeFieldName":   "",
        "recordModifiedFieldName":  "",
    },
    "mappings": [],                                    # REQUIRED — empty array
}
r = requests.post(f"{sf_instance}/services/data/v62.0/ssot/data-streams", headers=h, json=stream_payload)
```

**CRITICAL: A minimal payload (just name + connectorInfo) returns `INTERNAL_ERROR` on most orgs.** You MUST include `datastreamType`, `dataLakeObjectInfo` (with `dataspaceInfo`, `category`, `dataLakeFieldInputRepresentations`), and `mappings`. Do not guess — use the exact format above.

**After stream creation succeeds (201):**
- Capture stream name: `r.json().get("name")`
- Capture DLO name: `r.json().get("dataLakeObjectInfo", {}).get("name")`
- Poll for ACTIVE using stream name (NOT DLO name): `GET /ssot/data-streams/{stream_name}`
- Check: `body.get("dataLakeObjectInfo", {}).get("status") == "ACTIVE"`
- Poll every 10s, up to 5 min
- Wait additional 30s after ACTIVE before submitting bulk ingest (schema propagation delay)

**If stream already exists** ("already in use" in response text):
```python
r2 = requests.get(f"{sf_instance}/services/data/v62.0/ssot/data-streams", headers=h,
                  params={"connectorId": connector_id, "limit": 200})
for ds_item in r2.json().get("dataStreams", []):
    if schema_name.lower() in ds_item.get("name", "").lower():
        stream_name = ds_item["name"]
        break
# Then GET the stream to find its DLO name
r3 = requests.get(f"{sf_instance}/services/data/v62.0/ssot/data-streams/{stream_name}", headers=h)
dlo_name = r3.json().get("dataLakeObjectInfo", {}).get("name")
```

**Phase 3 — Bulk ingest**

```python
# Prepare CSV with snake_case columns matching schema field names
ingest_df = df.rename(columns={"Record ID": "record_id", "Date": "date", ...})
csv_data = ingest_df.to_csv(index=False)

# Create job — uses DC token and dc_domain (NOT sf_token/sf_instance)
job_payload = {"object": schema_name, "operation": "upsert", "sourceName": connector_short_name}
for retry in range(3):
    r = requests.post(f"https://{dc_domain}/api/v1/ingest/jobs",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {dc_token}", "Content-Type": "application/json"},
        json=job_payload)
    if r.status_code in (200, 201):
        break
    time.sleep(15)  # Retry on 404 — schema propagation delay

job_id = r.json().get("id")

# Upload CSV batch
r = requests.put(f"https://{dc_domain}/api/v1/ingest/jobs/{job_id}/batches",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {dc_token}", "Content-Type": "text/csv"},
    data=csv_data.encode("utf-8"))

# Close job
r = requests.patch(f"https://{dc_domain}/api/v1/ingest/jobs/{job_id}",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {dc_token}", "Content-Type": "application/json"},
    json={"state": "UploadComplete"})

# Poll for completion (5-10 minutes is normal)
for attempt in range(60):
    r = requests.get(f"https://{dc_domain}/api/v1/ingest/jobs/{job_id}",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {dc_token}", "Content-Type": "application/json"})
    state = r.json().get("state", "")
    if state == "JobComplete":
        break
    elif state == "Failed":
        raise RuntimeError(f"Ingest failed: {r.json()}")
    time.sleep(10)
```

**Key rules:**
- Use `dc_token` and `dc_domain` (NOT `sf_token`/`sf_instance`) — the bulk ingest API is a separate endpoint
- `sourceName` = the short connector name (e.g. `"analytics_connector"`), NOT the UUID name
- `operation` = `"upsert"` (not `"insert"` — insert returns 400)
- `object` = the schema name (same value used in stream creation)
- CSV column names must match schema field `name` values exactly (snake_case)
- Retry job creation on 404 — new schemas take 15-30s before the bulk API recognizes them

**Phase 4 — Build workspace + Semantic Data Model**

```python
# Reload config at start of phase (token may have rotated during ingest)
config = load_config(profile_key=PROFILE_KEY)
sf_token, sf_instance = get_sf_token(config, profile_key=PROFILE_KEY)
h = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {sf_token}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}

# Create workspace — response uses "name" key (not "apiName")
r = requests.post(f"{sf_instance}/services/data/v65.0/tableau/workspaces", headers=h,
    json={"label": f"{COMPANY} {USE_CASE}", "description": "..."})
ws_api = r.json().get("name")

# Create SDM — response uses "apiName" key
r = requests.post(f"{sf_instance}/services/data/v65.0/ssot/semantic/models", headers=h,
    json={"label": f"{COMPANY} {USE_CASE}", "description": "...", "dataspace": "default", "agentEnabled": True})
sdm_api = r.json().get("apiName")

# Add Data Object — MUST include both dataLakeObjectName AND dataObjectName, plus label
dlo_name = cp["dlo_name"]  # from Phase 2 stream creation response
r = requests.post(f"{sf_instance}/services/data/v65.0/ssot/semantic/models/{sdm_api}/data-objects", headers=h,
    json={"dataLakeObjectName": dlo_name, "dataObjectName": dlo_name, "dataObjectType": "dlo", "label": "..."})
do_api = r.json().get("apiName")

# Get field mappings from the DO
r = requests.get(f"{sf_instance}/services/data/v65.0/ssot/semantic/models/{sdm_api}/data-objects/{do_api}", headers=h)
measurements = r.json().get("semanticMeasurements", [])
dimensions = r.json().get("semanticDimensions", [])
# Build maps: field_name (without __c) → apiName
dim_field_map = {d["dataObjectFieldName"].replace("__c", ""): d["apiName"] for d in dimensions}
measurement_map = {m["dataObjectFieldName"].replace("__c", ""): m["apiName"] for m in measurements}
```

- Add calculated measurements (KPIs) and calculated dimensions (self-healing date shift)
- Create a `Display Date` calculated dimension using the **self-healing formula**:
  ```
  DATEADD("day", DATEDIFF("day", #<build_date>#, [DO_apiName].[date_field_apiName]), TODAY())
  ```
  where `<build_date>` is today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (hash-delimited date literal). This shifts every row by the distance between the build date and the current query date — the most recent data always appears as "today" with no manual refresh needed. Use `#YYYY-MM-DD#` syntax for date literals (NOT `DATE(y, m, d)` which fails with "Arguments mismatch").
- Save to checkpoint: `display_date_api`, `date_field_api`, `build_date` (today's ISO date)
- Add semantic metrics with `timeDimensionReference: {"calculatedFieldApiName": "Display_Date"}` (not `tableFieldReference`) and `singularNoun` / `pluralNoun` filled in

**Phase 4c — Field descriptions (AI optimization)**

After the DO is created and field apiNames are known, PUT a `description` on every measurement and dimension. These descriptions are displayed in the Tableau Next UI and used by the Concierge AI to understand what each field means — without them, Concierge cannot answer questions accurately.

**Measurements** — include `description` in the same PUT already made for `aggregationType`. No extra round-trip needed:

```python
requests.put(
    f'{sf_instance}/services/data/v65.0/ssot/semantic/models/{sdm}/data-objects/{do}/measurements/{m_api}',
    headers=h,
    json={
        'apiName': m_api,
        'label': mc['label'],
        'dataObjectFieldName': m_field,
        'aggregationType': mc['agg'],
        'description': mc['description'],   # ← add this
    }
)
```

**Dimensions** — PUT each one after the measurement loop. Endpoint: `PUT /services/data/v65.0/ssot/semantic/models/{sdm}/data-objects/{do}/dimensions/{dim_api}`

Required body fields: `apiName`, `label`, `dataObjectFieldName`, `description`. Example loop:

```python
for field_name, dim_api in dim_field_map.items():
    desc = DIM_DESCRIPTIONS.get(field_name)
    if not desc:
        continue
    requests.put(
        f'{sf_instance}/services/data/v65.0/ssot/semantic/models/{sdm}/data-objects/{do}/dimensions/{dim_api}',
        headers=h,
        json={
            'apiName': dim_api,
            'label': dim_api.replace('_', ' ').title(),
            'dataObjectFieldName': dim_api + '__c',
            'description': desc,
        }
    )
```

**Where to define descriptions in the script:**

Add a `description` key to every `METRIC_CONFIG` entry:

```python
METRIC_CONFIG = [
    {
        'label':       'Benefits Enrollment Rate',
        'field':       'benefits_enrollment_rate',
        'agg':         'Average',
        'is_rate':     True,
        'description': 'Percentage of eligible employees actively enrolled in at least one core benefits plan. Primary KPI — a sustained decline signals client health risk.',
        'singular':    'benefits enrollment rate',
        'plural':      'benefits enrollment rates',
    },
    ...
]
```

Add a separate `DIM_DESCRIPTIONS` dict at the top of the script (near `METRIC_CONFIG`) with a description for every dimension the audience might filter by:

```python
DIM_DESCRIPTIONS = {
    'vertical':       'Industry vertical of the client (e.g. Technology, Life Sciences, Nonprofit). Use to identify which industries are experiencing the largest enrollment declines.',
    'region':         'US geographic region of the client headquarters. Use to spot regional patterns in enrollment trends.',
    'size_band':      'Employee count band of the client. Micro clients (3–25) tend to show the earliest and sharpest enrollment drops.',
    'state':          'US state of the client headquarters. Use for granular geographic filtering within a region.',
    'plan_cost_tier': 'Whether the client is enrolled in a Low, Mid, or High cost benefits plan tier. High-cost tier clients show the strongest signal — cost sensitivity drives voluntary plan drop-off first.',
    'workforce_type': 'Primary workforce composition of the client (Technical, Administrative, Sales, Mixed). Technical workforces tend to have higher voluntary plan adoption and show sharper drops when enrollment declines.',
    'date':           'Date of the benefits activity record. Use to analyze trends over time.',
    'client_id':      'Unique identifier for the TriNet client (employer). Use to drill into a specific client\'s enrollment history.',
}
```

Generate descriptions using company/use-case context from the research step — they should be written for the Concierge AI to read, so phrase them as instructions: *"Use this field to..."* or *"This metric represents..."*

**Phase 4b — Business preferences (Concierge language)**
After all metrics are created, PUT each metric back with natural-language nouns that Concierge uses to generate responses. Pattern: GET the metric, update `insightsSettings.singularNoun` / `pluralNoun` / `sentiment`, strip read-only fields, PUT back.
- Endpoint: `PUT /services/data/v66.0/ssot/semantic/models/{sdm}/metrics/{metric_api}?minorVersion=12`
- Strip these fields before PUT: `id`, `createdBy`, `createdDate`, `lastModifiedBy`, `lastModifiedDate`
- Good noun examples: `"deal closed"` / `"deals closed"`, `"in-person sales activity"` / `"in-person sales activities"`
- Sentiment: `"SentimentTypeUpIsGood"` or `"SentimentTypeUpIsBad"`

**Phase 5 — Visualizations + Dashboard (use template library)**

**ALWAYS build the dashboard.** Do not ask the user whether to create it — every Tableau Next demo must have visualizations and a dashboard so assets appear in the workspace. Without vizzes, the workspace appears empty and the SDM is only accessible through Data 360.

**Step 5a — Present the visualization plan:**

```python
from viz_templates import recommend_dashboard_vizzes
from dashboard_builder import format_layout_preview

# Auto-recommend chart types from METRIC_CONFIG
viz_plan = recommend_dashboard_vizzes(METRIC_CONFIG, list(DIM_DESCRIPTIONS.keys()))

# Show ASCII preview
metric_labels = [mc['label'] for mc in METRIC_CONFIG[:3]]
viz_labels = [f"{v['label']} ({v['template'].replace('_', ' ').title()})" for v in viz_plan]
preview = format_layout_preview(metric_labels, viz_labels)
```

Print the preview and ask the user: **"Here's the dashboard I'll build — approve or edit?"**

- If **approve** (or user says nothing / "looks good" / "go"): build as shown
- If **edit**: user can change chart types, swap metrics, add/remove vizzes

Once approved, build each visualization using the template library:

```python
from viz_builder import build_viz_payload

payload = build_viz_payload(
    template_name=rec["template"],       # e.g. "trend_over_time"
    viz_name=f"{slug}_{rec['metric_field']}",
    viz_label=rec["label"],
    sdm_api=sdm_api,
    ws_api=ws_api,
    do_api=do_api,
    field_map={"measure": rec["metric_field"], "date": "date"},
    dim_field_map=dim_field_map,
    measurements=measurements,
    style_overrides=BRAND,               # brand colors (if defined)
)
# Validation runs automatically — will print failures before POST
r = requests.post(f"{VIZ_API_BASE}/tableau/visualizations",
                  headers=SF_HDR, params=VIZ_PARAMS, json=payload)
```

Available templates: `trend_over_time`, `multi_series_line`, `bar_by_category`, `stacked_bar`, `horizontal_bar`, `donut`, `scatter`, `heatmap`, `funnel`

After all vizzes are created, assemble the dashboard:

```python
from dashboard_builder import build_dashboard_payload

dash_payload = build_dashboard_payload(
    dash_name=f"{slug}_dashboard",
    dash_label=f"{company} {use_case} Dashboard",
    ws_api=ws_api,
    sdm_api=sdm_api,
    metric_apis=list(metric_api_map.values()),
    viz_apis=list(viz_apis.values()),
    layout="auto",                       # or "standard", "story_flow", etc.
    style_overrides={"dashboard_bg": BRAND.get("dashboard_bg", "#F3F3F3")},
)
r = requests.post(f"{VIZ_API_BASE}/tableau/dashboards",
                  headers=SF_HDR, params=VIZ_PARAMS, json=dash_payload)
```

Layout patterns available: `standard` (3 metrics + 2×2 vizzes), `metrics_heavy` (6 metrics + 3 vizzes), `story_flow` (3 metrics + wide hero + 2-up), `wide_viz` (3 metrics + 2 full-width)

After dashboard creation, share the workspace with all users:

```python
# Share workspace with all org users
share_url = f"{sf_instance}/services/data/v66.0/tableau/records/{ws_api}/shares?minorVersion=12"
share_payload = {"shareWith": "ALL_USERS", "accessLevel": "View"}
r = requests.post(share_url, headers=SF_HDR, json=share_payload)
if r.status_code in (200, 201):
    print("  Workspace shared with all users.")
```

**Key rules still apply:**
- Dashboard page `name` must be a UUID string
- `widgets` must be a dict, not a list
- Widget `source` must have only `"name"` key (no type/label)
- Metric widgets need `parameters.metricOption.sdmApiName`
- Container widgets must be in `widgets_dict` with `type: "container"`

**Retry cleanup — apply to EVERY phase that creates assets:**

This pattern must be applied to the workspace/SDM phase (phase 4) and the viz/dashboard phase (phase 6). Track every asset created across all runs (including failed ones) in the checkpoint:

- `all_ws_apis` — workspace names created by this script
- `all_sdm_apis` — SDM apiNames created by this script
- `all_viz_apis` — viz apiNames created by this script
- `all_dash_apis` — dashboard apiNames created by this script

These lists are **never cleared when resetting a phase** — they accumulate across retries so a retry always knows what to clean up.

At the start of each phase (workspace/SDM or viz/dashboard), before creating anything new:
1. DELETE every entry in the relevant lists
2. Reset those lists to `[]` in the checkpoint
3. Clear derived checkpoint keys that depend on the deleted assets (e.g. `ws_api`, `sdm_api`, `do_api` when re-running phase 4)
4. Save the checkpoint
5. After each successful creation, immediately append the new name to the list and save checkpoint

This ensures only one complete, working set of assets survives each run.

**Asset ownership rule (critical):**
- Only ever delete assets whose names are in the checkpoint tracking lists — i.e. assets this script created
- Never delete assets created outside this script (manually, by another build, etc.)
- If a user asks you to delete assets during a session, confirm the asset name appears in the checkpoint before proceeding. If it doesn't, say: "I don't have a record of creating that asset — please confirm you want me to delete it before I proceed."

**Phase 6 — Post-build steps**
- Create a dedicated subfolder for this demo: `demos/{company_slug}_{use_case_slug}/`
- Write the demo guide markdown file there (`{slug}_guide.md`)
- Generate a Concierge walkthrough `.docx` file there using python-docx (`{slug}_demo_walkthrough.docx`)
  - The `.docx` must include a **"Business Preferences (SDM)"** section at the end containing the full business preferences text (see below) with copy-paste instructions pointing to: Data 360 → Semantic Model → [SDM name] → AI Optimization → Manage Business Preferences
- Generate business preferences text tailored to the company/use case and save it to the checkpoint as `"business_preferences"`. Structure as `#`-prefixed instruction lines covering:
  - What the data represents (company context, what entities are tracked)
  - Which metrics are leading vs. lagging indicators
  - Which dimensions are most diagnostic for root-cause analysis
  - Any terminology clarifications (e.g. what "at-risk" means in this org)
  - Default time comparison preference (e.g. last 6 months vs. prior 6 months)
  - Any metric hierarchy notes (which to prioritize when similar metrics exist)
- Print a final summary block with:
  - All created asset names (metric names, viz names, dashboard name)
  - Direct URL to the Tableau Next workspace/dashboard
  - Direct URL to Tableau Pulse
  - Absolute file paths to the guide and walkthrough (so the user can click them)
  - The full business preferences text (reprinted inline for easy access)
  - A clear callout: "Open the walkthrough .docx for the Business Preferences text to paste into your SDM"
- Print the **ACTIONS REQUIRED** section (see "After the build" below) — this is where the scheduling instructions, goal setup, and business preferences paste are consolidated. This scheduling is only for Pulse demos.

### For CRMA output:

**Phase 1 — Data generation** (same as above)

**Phase 2 — Upload dataset to CRM Analytics**

Uses the same SF token from the active profile (CRMA lives in the same org as Tableau Next).

```python
from crma_uploader import build_metadata, fields_from_metric_config, upload_dataset, find_or_create_app
from crma_dashboard_builder import build_dashboard_state, create_dashboard, find_or_create_app

# Build metadata from METRIC_CONFIG
fields = fields_from_metric_config(METRIC_CONFIG, list(DIM_DESCRIPTIONS.keys()))
metadata = build_metadata(f"{slug}_fact", f"{company} {use_case}", fields)

# Prepare CSV with snake_case column names
ingest_df = df.copy()
ingest_df.columns = [c.lower().replace(" ", "_") for c in ingest_df.columns]
csv_bytes = ingest_df.to_csv(index=False).encode("utf-8")

# Upload
job_id, dataset_id = upload_dataset(
    sf_instance, sf_token,
    dataset_name=f"{slug}_fact",
    dataset_label=f"{company} {use_case}",
    metadata=metadata,
    csv_bytes=csv_bytes,
    app_name=app_label,  # optional: places in a CRMA app folder
)
```

**Important naming rules for CRMA fields:**
- Use snake_case for all field names (no spaces, no dots for simple datasets)
- Avoid reserved words: `location_id` → use `loc_id`; `name` → use `record_name`
- Date fields auto-derive `_Year`, `_Month`, `_Day` dimensions (use these for grouping)
- SAQL references the `name` from metadata, not the label

**Phase 3 — Create CRMA dashboard (template-based)**

Ask the user which dashboard template to use:

> "Which CRMA dashboard style would you like?
> 1. **Metrics Trend** — Time-series charts showing how metrics change over time (recommended for trend stories)
> 2. **Performance Summary** — Side-by-side metric comparison with dimension grouping
> 3. **Comparison Dashboard** — Two-column metric comparison
> 4. **Details Dashboard** — Charts + record-level details table
> 5. **Summary Dashboard** — Horizontal sections with filters
> 6. **Time Series** — Includes forecasting/trend projections
> 7. **Three-Column Dashboard** — Three-column layout with top filters
> 8. **Table Expansion** — Metrics over time with expandable detail rows"

Then create the dashboard from the template:

```python
from crma_dashboard_builder import create_dashboard_from_template

result = create_dashboard_from_template(
    sf_instance, sf_token,
    template_key="metrics_trend",      # user's choice
    app_label=f"{company} - {use_case}",
    dataset_id=dataset_id,             # from upload phase
    dataset_name=f"{slug}_fact",
    measure_fields=[mc["field"] for mc in METRIC_CONFIG[:4]],
    date_field="date",
    filter_fields=list(DIM_DESCRIPTIONS.keys())[:4],
)
# result = {"app_id": "...", "dashboard_id": "...", "dashboard_url": "..."}
```

This uses Salesforce's built-in Smart Templates which produce polished, professional dashboards. The template auto-discovers its required variables and maps our metrics/dimensions to the correct inputs.

**Key CRMA pitfalls:**
- Cannot `group by` `_sec_epoch` fields — use `_Year`, `_Month`, `_Day` instead
- Dataset re-upload creates a new version — security predicates must be re-applied
- Dashboard PATCH requires deep-unescaping HTML entities from GET response
- `datasets` arrays in steps must only contain `{"name": "..."}` (no label, id, url)
- Text widgets use `richTextContent` format, not Quill `ops`

### For CSV output:

- Generate the same DataFrame as above
- Export to `demos/{company_slug}_{use_case_slug}/{company_slug}_{use_case_slug}_{date}.csv`
- Print the file path

## After the build

Print the following structured summary when the build completes. Use clean markdown (headers, bold, bullet points) — no code blocks or ASCII box art.

**Format:**

> ## ✓ Build Complete
> 
> **Company:** {COMPANY}
> **Use Case:** {USE_CASE_LABEL}
> **Output:** {Pulse / Tableau Next / Both / CSV}
> **Build Date:** {today}
> 
> ### Phase Summary

> | Metrics | ✓ Complete |
> | Field Descriptions | ✓ Complete |
> | Business Preferences | ✓ Complete |
> | Visualizations | ✓ Complete |

> - **⊘ Skipped** — phase not applicable to this build type
> - **— Not run** — phase was never attempted (e.g. build interrupted before reaching it)
> 
> For Pulse builds, phases are: Data Generation, Prep Flow Build + Publish, Metric Creation, Group + Subscriptions, Insights (BAN/Brief)

> ## ⚠️ Actions Required
> 
> ### 1. Schedule the Auto-Refresh Flow
> **Where:** Tableau Cloud → Explore → {project_name} → "{flow_name}"
> **Do:** Click "+ Create new task" → set frequency to **{Daily/Weekly/Monthly}** (matches {GRAIN} grain)
> **Why:** Without this, Pulse sparklines show stale dates after {one day/one week/one month}. With it, dates stay permanently fresh — zero maintenance.
> 
> ### 2. Set Up Goal Lines in Pulse (only if goals defined)
> **Where:** Tableau Pulse → open metric → Edit → Goals
> **Do:** (list each metric and its goal field/direction/value)
> **Why:** Goal lines make the threshold visually urgent — the audience sees exactly when the metric crosses it.
> 
> ### 3. Paste Business Preferences (only if Tableau Next)
> **Where:** Data 360 → Semantic Model → {sdm_name} → AI Optimization → Manage Business Preferences
> **Do:** Paste the text from the "Business Preferences" section of the walkthrough .docx
> **Why:** Without this, Concierge asks clarifying questions back to the user instead of answering directly.
> 
> ### 4. Enable Analytics Agent Readiness (only if Tableau Next)
> **Where:** Data 360 → Semantic Model → {sdm_name} → Settings → Analytics Agent Readiness
> **Do:** Toggle ON
> **Why:** Required for Concierge to serve answers from this SDM.

**Rules for the Actions Required section:**
- Only include actions relevant to the build type (don't show Next actions for Pulse-only builds)
- Action 1 (schedule flow) is ALWAYS present for Pulse builds
- Action 2 (goals) only if `METRIC_CONFIG` entries have a `goal` key
- Actions 3-4 only for Tableau Next builds
- Number them sequentially (skip inapplicable actions — don't leave gaps)
- Each action has three lines: **Where** (navigation path), **Do** (the click), **Why** (consequence of skipping)

**Additional notes to print after the box:**

For Pulse:
- `use_dynamic_offset` is enabled — Pulse anchors to the most recent data point as a safety net even between flow runs
- The flow is self-contained (embedded CSV) — no external connections to break

For Tableau Next:
- The Display Date dimension is **self-healing** — `TODAY()` evaluates at query time, data always appears current automatically (no scheduling needed for Next)
- The Concierge panel is ready for Q&A demos immediately
- Open the walkthrough `.docx` for recommended demo prompts

For CSV:
- Open the file in Tableau Desktop, Excel, or any viz tool
- Use it to build custom views or upload to another platform

Note: the Tableau Next Concierge does not have a public REST API — it is UI-only. Business Preferences are also UI-only — the build generates the text, but you must paste it in manually.

## Post-build skill validation (automatic, silent)

**After every successful build**, silently compare what you actually did against what this skill documents. This catches drift — when a working build used a different pattern than what's documented, the skill needs updating.

**Check these (no user interaction needed — just compare internally):**

1. **Stream creation payload** — did you use the full payload format from Phase 2 (with `datastreamType`, `dataLakeObjectInfo`, `dataspaceInfo`, `mappings`)? If you had to modify it to make it work, flag it.
2. **Bulk ingest** — did you use `dc_token`/`dc_domain` (not SF token)? Did `sourceName` use the short connector name? Did you use `"upsert"` operation?
3. **Auth pattern** — did you reload config and pass `profile_key` between phases? Did token rotation work without re-auth?
4. **Workspace/SDM/DO** — did the response keys match what's documented (`"name"` for workspace, `"apiName"` for SDM/DO)?
5. **Metric creation** — did `timeDimensionReference` use `calculatedFieldApiName` for Display Date? Did CLC expressions use `[DO_apiName].[measurement_apiName]` format?
6. **Viz/Dashboard** — did `build_viz_payload` and `build_dashboard_payload` work, or did you have to modify payloads?

**If any phase required a workaround not documented in this skill or CLAUDE.md Known Pitfalls:**

1. Append the fix to `discovered_fixes.md` in the project root with this format:
   ```markdown
   ## [DATE] — [Short description]
   **Phase:** [which phase]
   **Error:** [what failed]
   **Fix:** [what worked]
   **Payload/code:** [the working code if applicable]
   ```
2. Tell the user: "I discovered a new fix during this build and logged it to `discovered_fixes.md`. This will be reviewed for inclusion in the main skill on your next update."

**Do NOT directly edit CLAUDE.md or the skill files** — only the project owner pushes changes to those. Your job is to log the discovery so it can be evaluated.

This ensures fixes from all users are captured and can be merged into the main skill by the maintainer.

---

## Session summary (auto-save after every build)

After the build completes (or if it's interrupted and the user ends the conversation), save a session summary to the memory system:

**File:** `sessions/demo_{company_slug}_{use_case_slug}_{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`

**Contents:**

```markdown
---
name: demo-{company_slug}-{use_case_slug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}
description: {Company} {use case} demo build — {output modes used}
metadata:
  type: project
---

## Demo: {Company} — {Use Case}

**Built:** {date}
**Output modes:** {Pulse / Next / CRMA / CSV}
**Persona:** {who the demo is for}

## Decisions made
- Primary metric(s): {list}
- Supporting metrics: {list}
- Dimensions: {list}
- Signal: {magnitude}% decline over {onset} months, {shape} shape
- Brand colors: {if applicable}
- Advanced settings: {if used}

## Assets created
- **Pulse:** project "{name}", datasource "{name}", metrics: {list with def IDs}
- **Next:** workspace "{api}", SDM "{api}", DO "{api}", dashboard "{name}"
- **CRMA:** app "{name}", dataset "{id}", dashboard "{name}"
- **Files:** {absolute paths to script, guide, walkthrough, CSV}

## Checkpoint
- Path: `demos/{slug}/{slug}_checkpoint.json`
- Phases completed: {list}

## Issues encountered
- {any errors, workarounds, or quirks discovered during this build}

## User notes for next time
- {anything the user said they might want to add, change, or revisit}

## Resume instructions
To pick up this demo: load the checkpoint at the path above, skip completed phases,
and ask the user what they'd like to add or change.
```

If updating an existing demo (user resumed and made changes), update the existing session summary file rather than creating a new one — append the new changes to the "User notes" and "Assets created" sections.

---

## Cleanup

To remove a demo and all its assets, Claude can run cleanup steps on request. Specify the company name and timestamp to target a specific build.
